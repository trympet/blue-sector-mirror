# Blue-Sector
Virtual Reality app for exploring blue sector workplaces and professions.

## Getting started
1. Ensure Unity `2021.3.5f1` is installed
1. `git clone git@github.com:vr4vet/Blue-Sector.git`
1. Obtain and download [BNG framework](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066) and put it in the `Assets/` folder
1. Obtain FishMerd component and put it in the `Assets/FishFeeding/Components/` folder

## Development
This project strives to follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for commit messages.
In an effort to make this specification more convenient to follow, we include a gitmessage template.

To use this template, ensure you are in the root of the project and run the command:

`git config commit.template .gitmessage`

This will set your local gitmessage template to the included file. 
If the -m flag is used when issuing a commit the template will be ignored.
